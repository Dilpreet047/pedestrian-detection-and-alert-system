# pedestrian-detection-and-alert-system
The program for detecting pedestrians and alerting the security systems. This type of program will be useful in surveillance cameras. 

**Packages required**
1. OpenCV
2. Imutils
3. Playsound

Whenever the program detects any pedestrian, a security alarm sound is played using playsound python package. This program can also be developed to send notifications to the concerned authorities whenever a pedestrian is detected.

In conventional surveillance cameras, a person has to constantly watch the video recordings to detect any pedestrian in the region of surveillance. This dependency can be eliminated using this program.
